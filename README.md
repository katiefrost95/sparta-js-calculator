Tasks
Your task is to write a command line calculator application that has two settings, (b)asic and (a)dvanced.
* First you will need to ask the user for which calculator they want to use
* Then you will need to ask the user for the numbers to operate on.
* Then you need to work out what to do with the numbers, depending on what operation they choose.

Bonus task - Add some additional functionality
Add the following calculator feature into your app.

BMI Calculator
Calculate the BMI when given the height and weight - the user should be able to choose between the imperial and the metric system
* BMI Link 1
* BMI Link 1

## What I found hard
As a whole I found this task quite tricky, but mostly just knowing how to start it off, once I got that down it went okay--ish. Knowing how to write the syntax for the BMI calculator was also hard but I got there in the end.

## What Went well
That the calculator actually works.
